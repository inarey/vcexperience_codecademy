# vcexperience_codecademy

This is a Codecademy responsive website challenge project. 
The goal is to redesign or design own company's website implementing flexbox. 
Since we are learning full stack development, thought it would be nice to practice designing the UI as well.
So I created the prototype on figma before I started coding.
